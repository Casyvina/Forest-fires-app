# Forest-fires - Machine Learning

## What does this project entails?
Forest, bush or vegetation fire, can be described as any uncontrolled and non prescribed combustion or burning of plants in
a natural setting such as a forest, grassland, etc.
In this project we are not determining if a forest fire will take place or not, we are predictiong the confidence of the Forest Fire based on some attributes.

## Details of the Project
The project is divided into three parts
- 1. Buidiing a machine learning model to predict forest fire confidence.
  2. We build a web app on Django to mount the prediction model.
  3. We deploy the Django on Heroku

## Machine Learning Model
So we start off with building a machine learning model using RandomForestRegression model and train the model using the dataset.
For this project you will also see RandomSearchCV in action.
